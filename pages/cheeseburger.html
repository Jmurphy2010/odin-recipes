    <p>This is a recipe for a cheeseburger!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut onions, tomatoes, lettuce and get out your ketchup, mustard, mayo</li>
        <li>Shape your beef patties - slightly larger than your buns. No more than 3/4in thick</li>
        <li>Fire up the grill and get your patties staged for grilling</li>
        <li>Grill the beef patties, flipping as little as possible to preserve the juicy flavor</li>
        <li>Once patties are nearly done, put a slice of cheese on each patty and toast your burger buns. Close the lid to melt the cheese</li>
        <li>Remove from grill once both sides are a deep charred brown</li>
        <li>Put 1-2 patties on each set of buns. Top with condiments to hearts content</li>
    </ol>
